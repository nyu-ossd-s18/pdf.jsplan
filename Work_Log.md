3/24 - Today we made sure everyone had the source code. We updated our fork in GitHub by using this really cool upstream thing. 
It was lit. We then installed all the dependencies from npm, including some gulp server stuff. That was lit too. From this, we 
learned to build and use PDF.js in our local. Oh yeah, we also got into the IRC. It was dead there. Not so lit. We then all
brushed up on the style guide and triage standards. A little wordy for me, but I hear from the others that it was lit.
